#musicXml2scratch

musicXml2scratch converts musicXML files (see http://www.musicxml.org/)
into text files which can be imported into a Scratch (see http://scratch.mit.edu) project
from where they can just be played to your audience or even build a Synthesia, Guitar Hero,
whatever-like game.

This project is **unstable** and might/will produce strange output. For a list of known, bugs,
visit the [Issues].
